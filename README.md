•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I would try to figure out what users want by talking to them, doing surveys, and researching the market. Once you know what users need, you need to be able to turn those ideas into specific software features. To create the software, you need to have people in different roles to help build the project. These roles include designing, coding, and testing the software to make sure everything works well. User stories are an important way to get short descriptions of what users want from a program from the user's point of view. User stories help clarify what features they want and why. This helps teams create plans on what to build. They also help teams work better together and keep everyone focused on what is important.

•	How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs would be to do it in stages. I would stop and fix problems when they come up. I would also include times when I get feedback to make sure I am still on track for what the customer wants. Agile methods like Scrum or Kanban break work into smaller parts. These would help me to manage tasks better but also let me change things as needed. Scrum is a good way to organize work into short sprint cycles, with regular meetings to plan, review progress, and learn from what worked and what didn’t. Kanban boards would help me see what tasks are being worked on, limit how much work is started at once, and keep things moving smoothly.

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means that you need to be able to talk openly with teammates and others involved to understand what is needed and give you a chance to share your progress. Good team members help teammates, they are respectful of others’ ideas, and they need to be able to work well together to solve problems. You also need to be open to change, you need to be able to learn from mistakes, and you need to spend time looking for ways to improve how the team works together.
